 <Object of the game >
the object of the game is for the player to guess all the letters in a hidden, random phrase. 

At the start of the game, the player will be given the numbers of letters and words in the phrase. These are represented with black boxes on the screen.

 the player guesses the letters in a phrase by clicking letters on a keyboard that's on the screen or their physical keyboard. 

 once the letter is selected, it's disabled and the player can't select it again.

 if the selected letter is in the phrase atleast once, the letter and the position on the screen will be highlighted. all instances of the letter are made visible. I.E if there are 3 a's all a's in the phrase will appear at the same time.

 if the selected letter isn't in the phrase the player loses a heart.

 The player keeps choosing letters until they reveal the phrase or they lost their five lives.
